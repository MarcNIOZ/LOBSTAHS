# LOBSTAHS_dev

Development repo for the LOBSTAHS (Lipid and Oxylipin Biomarker Screening Through Adduct Hierarchy Sequences) lipidomics pipeline. [Jamie Collins](https://github.com/jamesrco) is turning these scripts into an R package at https://github.com/LOBSTAHS.

LOBSTAHS replaces the old Van Mooy Lab lipidomics pipeline, which has been moved to https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/old_pipeline
